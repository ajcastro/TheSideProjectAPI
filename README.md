# The SideProject API

Sample (Laravel) API to demonstrate [Scribe's](http://scribe.knuckles.wtf) API documentation capabilities. See the docs at [sample.scribe.knuckles.wtf](http://sample.scribe.knuckles.wtf).


The docs are built with `php artisan scribe:generate`, and then moved into the docs/ folder, so that GitHub Pages can work with them. This two-step process is handled with the `composer docs` command.
